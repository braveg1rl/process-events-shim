# process-events-shim [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/process-events-shim.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/process-events-shim) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/meryn/process-events-shim.png)](https://david-dm.org/meryn/process-events-shim)

Shims process event functionality.

## Usage

```javascript
require("process-events-shim")
```

This will do nothing 

* if not running in the browser,
* if any of the event functions are defined on `process` already, or
* if `window.onerror` is not `null` when this module is loaded

In Browserify-like environments, the following will happen:

* the `process` object will get the standard [EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html) methods.
* `window.onerror` will be a function that emits an `uncaughtException` event on the process object.
* a listener gets added to the window's `unload` event which emits an `exit` event on the process object.
